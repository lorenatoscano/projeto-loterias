## About
This is a React front-web project that shows lottery results, and it was developed for the "Javascript's Frameworks" subject of the Bachelor of Information Technology degree program.

The homework given required us to create an SPA (Single Page Application) that had different components communicating with each other (parent-child communication and/or data sharing), with different routes and using web services (e.g. REST API).

I did the project based on this [Brainn's front-end exercise](https://github.com/brainnco-exs/readme-frontend). Their [API](https://brainn-api-loterias.herokuapp.com/) and [layout prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/H2qrYBCFMf4didYmxRwTxP/Brainn-Frontend-Challenge) were very useful.

## Used technologies
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/) for route creation
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
- [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for some components' specific styles
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/ptbr/docs/intro) for API requests.


##  How to run?
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/lorenatoscano/projeto-loterias.git

# Change to repository directory
$ cd projeto-loterias

# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run the application
$ yarn start
```

Access http://localhost:3000/ address in your browser to see the result.

## To do
Some of the ideas I intend to do later on to improve the application:
- Add mobile screen responsive designs.
- Add a "loading" indicator while the requests are in execution and the content is being loaded.
- Fetch and show actual drawing results from [CAIXA](http://loterias.caixa.gov.br/wps/portal/loterias)'s lotteries.
